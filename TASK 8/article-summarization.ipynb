With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some air\nSample summary: Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk .\nU.S consumer advisory group says minimum space must be stipulated .\nSafety tests conducted on planes with more leg room than airlines offer .\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\nmodel_name = \"sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6\"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nsummarizer = pipeline(\n    \"summarization\",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    device=0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1\n)\n\n# Test on sample article\nsample_article = test_dataset[10][\"article\"].strip()[:1024]\nprint(\"\\nOriginal Article:\", sample_article[:1250] + \"...\")\n\nsummary = summarizer(\n    sample_article,\n    max_length=128,\n    min_length=30,\n    num_beams=4,\n    early_stopping=True\n)\n\nprint(\"\\nGenerated Summary:\", summary[0][\"summary_text\"])","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-08T16:41:59.595016Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-08T16:41:59.595286Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-08T16:42:02.908742Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-08T16:41:59.595269Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-08T16:42:02.907972Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Device set to use cuda:0\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nOriginal Article: Biting his nails nervously, these are the first pictures of the migrant boat captain accused of killing 900 men, women and children in one of the worst maritime disasters since World War Two.
